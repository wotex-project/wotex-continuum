# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Until a stable release, only the latest published pre-1.0 release receives
security fixes.

## Reporting

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to `hello@wotex.io`. Include the
affected version, minimal reproduction, impact, and any known mitigation. Do
not open a public issue before maintainers coordinate disclosure.

## Boundary

The library handles untrusted JSON but performs no network, filesystem,
credential, process, or database operation. Its decoder enforces byte, nesting,
collection-size, and string-size limits supplied by the consumer. Defaults are
conservative and can be tightened.

Consumer hosts remain responsible for:

- authenticating and authorizing principals;
- validating Thing Description and DataSchema meaning through the Wotex core;
- preventing Action replay and enforcing idempotency;
- resolving evidence URIs under an allowlist;
- redacting sensitive values before logging;
- bounding persistence and delivery queues; and
- treating decoded values as proposals, never authority.

An Action intent or result is data only. Decoding it cannot authorize or
execute an Action.

## Dependency audit and Decimal parser boundary

On 2026-09-08, `mix hex.audit` reports no matching advisory for the exact locked
dependency set. The project therefore carries no advisory suppression. The
[Decimal maintainer advisory](https://github.com/ericmj/decimal/security/advisories/GHSA-rhv4-8758-jx7v)
identifies versions before 3.0.0 as affected; this repository locks Decimal
3.1.1.

Dependency security tests retain a defense-in-depth boundary: they bind the
exact 3.1.1 Hex lock tuple, including outer checksum
`c5f25f2ced74a0587d03e6023f595db8e924c9d3922c8c8ffd9edfc4498cf1f6`,
to the loaded version and prove that default parse, cast and construction limits
reject pathological exponents and over-limit digit counts. No arithmetic on a
pathological value is executed.

This evidence is not a general Decimal safety or whole-VM memory guarantee. Any
dependency or advisory change requires a fresh review. A failed regression,
changed lock or audit finding blocks `mix check`. Never disable parsing limits
for untrusted input.
